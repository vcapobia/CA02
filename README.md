Name of Project: 
CA_02_Naive_Bayes

Overview of Project:
This project trains the model using two functions (make_Dictionary and extract_features) to identify spam vs. non-spam emails using Guassian Naive Bayes model. The model is first 'trained' using model.fit function and Training Datset. Then then Trained Model is run with the Test Data Set and an accuracy score is printed to identify model performance. 

Installation Instructions:
Upload data into Google Drive using the following pathways: My Drive/MSBA_Colab_2020/ML_Algorithms/CA_02/Data/train-mails and My Drive/MSBA_Colab_2020/Data/test-mails
Open a colab notebook with the commented code and mount your drive in one of two ways: 1. Press the Mount Drive button on the right hand sidebar in your Colab Notebook (button looks like a filled in folder) 2. import google.colab import drive drive.mount('/count/drive')

Operating Instructions:
Once your drive is mounted, run both functions individually to ensure there are no erros. Then, run the Main Program cell, this may take several minutes. The end results should print Completed classification of the Test Data and an Accuracy Score
